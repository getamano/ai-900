## 1. Introduction to AI

### What is AI?
- **Definition:** AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.
- **Components of AI:** 
  - **Perception:** The ability to interpret data from the world.
  - **Reasoning:** The ability to solve problems and make decisions.
  - **Learning:** The ability to improve performance based on experience.
  - **Interaction:** The ability to communicate with humans and other systems.

### Types of AI
- **Narrow AI:** 
  - **Definition:** AI designed for a specific task.
  - **Examples:** Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa.
- **General AI:** 
  - **Definition:** AI with general cognitive abilities like a human.
  - **Examples:** Theoretical concept, not yet realized.

## 2. Machine Learning

### Definition
- Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

### Types of Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning:**
  - **Definition:** The model is trained on labeled data.
  - **Examples:** Classification (e.g., email spam detection), Regression (e.g., predicting house prices).
- **Unsupervised Learning:**
  - **Definition:** The model works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns.
  - **Examples:** Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation), Association (e.g., market basket analysis).
- **Reinforcement Learning:**
  - **Definition:** The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
  - **Examples:** Training a robot to navigate a maze, game playing like AlphaGo.
